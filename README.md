# django-tutorial-ish
Modeled off of the Django tutorial project.

Here is the Django tutorial I used.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/
It essentially walks the reader through making a simple website to collect votes
from poll questions. Through this, it explains Django's file structure, the use
of routes, views, and models (and how this involves interfacing with a database),
and how to create view templates as well as use generics to simplify them.

I had already gone through this for Project 1, so it wouldn't be very
interesting to model this directly off of the tutorial. Thus, I basically went
off and created my own thing: a very low functionality forum where people can
write posts. I used the generic templates and everything that was used in the
tutorial as well as forms, which we had learned outside of the tutorial for
Project 1. I also figured out that my browser cache was preventing me from
seeing updates to the CSS (which I never got around to figuring out before).
